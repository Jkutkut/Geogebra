**·[Parabola](https://www.geogebra.org/graphing/rzgkaw2m)**: Simple way to visualize a parabola and rotate it.
  
    Defined by:
  
    -α = angle of rotation
    -(h,k) = vertex's coordinates V = (h,k).
    -p = distance from V to the focus (F) or to the diretrix (D).

**·[3D_Shapes](https://www.geogebra.org/3d/cjwuydqx): Simple way to visualize:
    
    Sphere, Ellipsoid, HyperbolicParaboloid,
    HyperboloidOneSheet,HyperboloidTwoSheets, EllipticParaboloid.
    
  *It uses the same notation as the parabola*
